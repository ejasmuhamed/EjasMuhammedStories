I write because I read—it gives definition and clarity to my thoughts, influencing my actions.

Articulating my ideas through writing **solidifies** my understanding. The content I **consume** shapes my **clarity**.

Choosing content aligning with my thoughts enhances clarity. I'm mindful of **sources** where I consume from.

Writing a book was a long term dream, and I realised that **my pot was empty**. Now, I read and write to fill my pot.

Writing these short posts with relevant reading **brings clarity**.

Reading a book from an author who researched a decade (to write it) gives me instant accessibility to a decade long research.

I read to write!

**Are you a reader too?**

----------

_Recently (as of Jan 2023) I started to read more relevant stuff and started to articulate my thoughts. These actions helped me in gaining more clarity. Thoughts are not just thoughts anymore; I am writing and defining them._

_Thanks to **Fathima Nasreen**, my wife, companion and my best friend for mentioning that I was clueless because my pot was empty. She keeps reminding me about the Qur’an and how it can define us as a person._

_Thanks to [**Faris Mohamed**](https://farismohamed.me), my akhi (once a college junior, became a friend, then a co-founder to a brother) for sharing relevant stuff to read._
