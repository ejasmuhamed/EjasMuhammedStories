Often I picture myself as an astronaut 👨🏻‍🚀 who **explores the outer space**, returning with **exciting cosmic stones**. ☄️

In this cosmic journey, the treasures are the help, opportunities, kindness and shared experiences that **I bring to my world—my family, team, and friends**. ✨

When I built **[Bytsolv 🚀](https://byt.so)** with my team, I ensured its design theme mirrored outer-space; **my playground**. 🔭 Together, my team and I explore the cosmic stones! 🛸

This analogy resonates with me. 🪐

_Do you have such an analogy?_
