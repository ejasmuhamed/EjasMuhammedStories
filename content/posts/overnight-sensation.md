Does anybody value real these days?

By adding flashy effects to vertical videos and adding a viral music to it can make you famous in a day?! **And hence an influencer is born instantly.**

Leading to the pressure of maintaining their fame through constant content creation, often **devoid value**.

I find myself longing for a time when r**espect was earned** through **genuine achievements** in science, technology, and other fields that **contributed to the betterment of humanity**.

 

Today, we live in a world where influencersâ€™ opinions are often valued more than those of experts. This shift is a troubling sign of misplaced priorities.

It is indeed a worrying situation. The value we place on superficial fame overshadows the recognition that should be given to those who work tirelessly for our society.

**MASKS EVERYWHERE; NOISE!**

Will this go viral?, **absolutely NOT!**
