Handshakes are slippery but contracts are not. Here is an experience shared on how important is contracts along with strong handshakes.

You gotta have **clarity and fairness in business**. You and the people around your business **should know the way forward**. Let’s consider a story, rather an experience.

1️⃣ Once, I decided to partner with someone on a project. Excited about our collaboration, we jumped right in without putting anything in writing but a handshake. We did not realise that the **handshake was slippery**. Big mistake. As the project progressed, disagreements arose, and without clear terms, **both of us did not know what the terms was**, things quickly went out of control. It was a lesson learned **the hard way**.

2️⃣ Fast forward to another project with a new client. This time, we both signed a contract before getting started. The contract outlined our responsibilities, deadlines, and payment terms, and most importantly **the default clause and the cancellation clause**. With everything clearly **spelled out**, there was no room for misunderstandings or disputes. We knew our path, we knew how to make it work, **we knew how to cancel it** and **we knew the cost of defaulting**. Everything clear. The project went smoothly, and our partnership flourished.

When both parties agree to the terms and sign on the dotted line, it creates a **foundation of trust and accountability**. Moreover, contracts also provide a safety net in case things don't go as planned. They establish procedures for resolving disputes and ensure fair treatment for all involved.

_While not always necessary, registering contracts legally adds an extra layer of security. It provides official recognition of the agreement and strengthens its enforceability if needed._

So, the next time you're entering into a business arrangement, remember **handshakes are slippery, contracts are strong!**


**Additional Points to note:**

-   Write the contract mutually.
-   Add cancellation and default clauses. You need to know how to get out of the deal if required, and what is the cost of defaulting as well.
-   Read the contract in detail, do not miss a word! Full clarity!
-   Ask if the other party feels the contract is fair, as it explicitly!
-   Sign it. Now do the real handshake.
-   Both parties keep a copy and use this as a single source of truth for the partnership / business.
-   Your trustworthiness and credibility lies on how you treat the terms of the contract!

> **“O you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations [or contracts]” 
> _[al-Maa’idah 5:1]_**


> Hakim b. Hazim (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying: Both parties in a business transaction have the right to annul it so long as they have not separated; and if they speak the truth and make everything clear they will be blessed in their transaction; but if they tell a lie and conceal anything the blessing on their transaction will be blotted out. 
> _Sahih Muslim 1532a (Book 21, Hadith 57) #10985_
