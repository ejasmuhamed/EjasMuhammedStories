**Do you escape often?** From the tedious job that you should do and you are sure that by doing it, things will be where you want it to be.

How often do we find ourselves fleeing away from **the demands of our responsibilities**? We escape from the tasks we know we should tackle, convinced that delaying them won't significantly alter the outcome.

We've all tempted to this at some point, leaving excuses to ourselves like "**I'm exhausted**, I'll tackle it tomorrow," or "I've done enough for today," or even "**This can surely wait**."

But in reality, are these justifications **cooked-up to convince ourselves** on the reluctance to face the real work at hand?

Such escapes gives us an initial comfort, but inevitably, the cushion we've settled into **loses its softness**.
