I started my career building website and playing around with tech stuff.

My cousin brother started a company and I joined him as the CTO; **with minimal knowledge and wisdom** in the tech domain. A leap from building websites to heading a company's tech team; **impossible**, but that happened.

I made a **significant error** in not starting slow, opting rapid climb up **the leadership ladder**. The C-suite title **tempted** me more than the Junior Software Engineer role. Ever since that, I have never worked below a C-suite role, or rather **I was not able to**.

I faced the _**dual reality**_ of being unprepared for the position and the pressure to quickly acquire the necessary skills. In the middle of chaos, I somehow fulfilled the responsibilities.

Fast forwarding to today, I see young talents choosing the C-suite in their own one week old company; the only advice echoes ‘**start slow**’.

Titles will be tempting, but think long term, think stable, think realistic, think without bluffing to yourself, don’t try to bypass milestones. _**The process you hate is the process you need!**_

----------

_These are not regrets but learnings from the mistakes that I have done whilst building my career. I lead a team of engineers now. I was created from the learnings, advices from wise people and moreover a lot of trials and errors. I wish people to discover the slow but fast alternate journey._
