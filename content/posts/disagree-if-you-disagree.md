During conversations with my co-founders, whenever I hear something that **I disagree** with, I convey it to them. I make an effort to be polite when expressing my disagreement.

But what if I don’t convey it and act as if there is no disagreement? **It's a lie**, or the truth hidden.

If you never express your disagreement and instead decide to reach a compromise where your opinions are suppressed, from then on, **you are lying**, and **you lose significance**.

*Example: Suppose you and I are discussing something, and I propose an opinion that benefits me. You don’t agree with me but choose to suppress your opinion and follow my lead. Now, I start to believe that we are on the same page when, in reality, we are not. If this pattern continues, with you always agreeing with me despite your disagreement, eventually, **you become irrelevant** because you never assert yourself. **Here, I am the only relevant person**.*

A conversation gains meaning when all participants contribute. When you express your disagreement, it clarifies your thoughts and helps others understand your perspective.

I see unexpressed disagreement as **small lies**. If this behaviour persists, it becomes a significant lie that you must **believe every day**.

Here are some examples of how we can politely express disagreement:

- “Hmm… I don’t really agree with what you just said; I think _______ would be better.”
- “I respect your ideas, but I disagree with this part.”
- “Are you certain about this? I have a different opinion, and I think we should discuss it further.”
- “I'm not entirely convinced about this, but perhaps we could give it a try.”

*Inspired from the events that occurred in my career and from the healthy arguments and disagreements me and my co-founders had.*

*Before and after any heated conversations, disagreements or arguments, I always convey that we fought for what’s best for the company, we are not arguing for our personal egos.*
