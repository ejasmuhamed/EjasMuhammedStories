[{"content":"Slow is fast! I started my career building website and playing around with tech stuff.\nMy cousin brother started a company and I joined him as a CTO. A CTO with minimal knowledge and wisdom in the tech domain. A leap from building websites to heading a company\u0026rsquo;s tech team; impossible, but that happened.\nI made a significant error in not starting slow, opting rapid climb up the leadership ladder. The C-suite title tempted me more than the Junior Software Engineer role. Ever since that, I have never worked below a C-suite role, or rather I was not able to.\nI faced the dual reality of being unprepared for the position and the pressure to quickly acquire the necessary skills. Somehow, in the middle of chaos, I somehow fulfilled the responsibilities.\nFast forwarding to today, I see young talents choosing the C-suite in their own 1 week old company; the only advice echoes ‘start slow’.\nTitles will be tempting, but think long term, think stable, think realistic, think without bluffing to yourself, don’t try to bypass milestones. The process you hate it the process you need!\nThese are not regrets but learnings from the mistakes that I have done whilst building my career. I lead a team of engineers now. I was created from the learnings, advices from wise people and moreover a lot of trial and error. I wish people to the slow but fast alternate journey.\n","permalink":"/posts/slow-is-fast/","summary":"Slow is fast!
